The efficiency of sorting algorithms is usually described using Big O notation, which represents the upper bound of the algorithm's time complexity in terms of the input size (n).
Insertion Sort: Average case time complexity is O(n^2) because for each element, it may need to compare and shift the entire sorted part of the array. It is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets.
Big O:
Merge Sort: Average and worst-case time complexity is O(n log n). It has a more efficient runtime than insertion sort for large datasets, making it suitable for sorting larger arrays.
